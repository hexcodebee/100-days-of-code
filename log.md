# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Restarted freeCodeCamp from the first HTML exercise. Restarted #100DaysofCode on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Since I've rebranded my socials, I thought it only made sense to reboot everything else. Repetition is never bad.

### Day 4: September 4, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Applied Visual Design section of freeCodeCamp today. I love animating stuff with code. So so much!

**Thoughts:** I am still glad to be working my way back through this material. I know what I plan to do for my tribute page project this time, but it's good to be refreshing my knowledge before I get there.
