# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31, 2019
#####

**Today's Progress**: Restarted freeCodeCamp from the first HTML exercise. Restarted #100DaysofCode on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Since I've rebranded my socials, I thought it only made sense to reboot everything else. Repetition is never bad.
