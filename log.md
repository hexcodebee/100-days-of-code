# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarted freeCodeCamp from the first HTML exercise. Restarted #100DaysofCode on Twitter.

**Thoughts:** Since I've rebranded my socials, I thought it only made sense to reboot everything else. Repetition is never bad.

**Today's Progress**: I worked through CSS exercises on freeCodeCamp today. I also launched my portfolio website! www.jakebfletcher.com

**Thoughts:** I need to figure out how to make a few images secure so that I get that green lock for SSL.
